# ShiftLogger API and Console 
API Shift Logger and Cosole Program
# Requirements 
 - [x] This is an application where you should record a worker's shifts.
 - [x] You need to create two applications: the Web API and the UI that will call it.
 - [x] All validation and user input should happen in the UI app.
 - [x] Your API's controller should be lean. Any logic should be handled in a separate "service".
 - [x] You should use SQL Server, not SQLite
 - [x] You should use the "code first" approach to create your database, using Entity Framework's migrations tool.
 - [x] Your front-end project needs to have try-catch blocks around the API calls so it handles unexpected errors (i.e. the API isn't running or returns a 500 error.)

Challanges
  - [x] I initially had some prolems understanding how to build the API.  I had to watch several videos and read a lot of documentation before it clicked.  The pattern is different than anything I've done before.
  - [x] I planned out this project better than the others before.  I still had some refactoring, but it was much reduced.
